# 🛡️ PoE Leveling Planner - Antivirus-Safe Edition

## 🚀 Quick Start (No Antivirus Issues!)

Since antivirus software sometimes blocks compiled executables, this version runs directly from Python source code - completely safe and transparent!

### ✅ **What You Have Now:**

Your project is **ready to run** with these files:
- ✅ `PoE-Leveling-Planner-Portable.bat` - **Main launcher (click this!)**
- ✅ `setup_windows.bat` - One-time dependency installer
- ✅ `run_windows.bat` - Alternative launcher
- ✅ All Python source files (main.py, config_gui.py, etc.)
- ✅ Updated config without position setting (always centered)

### 🎯 **How to Run:**

1. **First Time Only**: Double-click `setup_windows.bat` to install dependencies
2. **Every Time**: Double-click `PoE-Leveling-Planner-Portable.bat` to run

That's it! No antivirus problems, no quarantined files.

## 🎮 **What You'll See:**
