# Gem Cards Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
The gems section has been completely redesigned to use a card-based layout instead of the previous row-based display. Each quest is now presented as an individual card with improved functionality and visual appeal.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. Quest Cards Layout
- **Card Design**: Each quest is displayed as a separate card with a raised border
- **Same Width as Overlay**: Cards use the same width as the configured overlay width (minimum 200px)
- **Responsive Grid**: Cards automatically arrange in multiple columns based on available space
- **Fixed Height**: All cards have consistent height (200px) for uniform appearance
- **Even Spacing**: Cards are evenly distributed across rows with proper padding

### 2. Card Content Structure
- **Quest Title**: Prominently displayed at the top in bold font
- **Act Information**: Shows the act number below the title in gray text
- **Centered Gem Column**: All gems are displayed in a vertical column, centered within the card

### 3. Clickable Gem Selection
- **Interactive Buttons**: Each gem is now a clickable button instead of a static label
- **Selection State**: Clicking a gem selects it and highlights it with:
  - Bold font weight
  - Colored background matching gem type
  - Thicker border (3px vs 1px)
  - Solid relief style
- **Deselection**: Clicking a selected gem again deselects it
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects provide immediate visual feedback

### 4. Gem State Management
- **Grayed Out Effect**: When one gem is selected, all other gems in that quest become grayed out
- **Color Coding**: Gems maintain their original color coding:
  - üî¥ Red gems: `#ff6b6b` with light red background
  - üü¢ Green gems: `#51cf66` with light green background  
  - üîµ Blue gems: `#339af0` with light blue background
  - ‚ö´ Other gems: Gray fallback colors
- **State Persistence**: Selection states are maintained across application restarts

### 5. Data Persistence
- **Automatic Saving**: Gem selections are automatically saved when changed
- **Character-Specific**: Each character maintains their own gem selections
- **Quest Identification**: Selections are stored using quest name + act as unique keys
- **Config Integration**: Data is stored in the existing config.json structure
- **Immediate Persistence**: Changes are saved immediately to prevent data loss

### 6. Enhanced User Experience
- **Hover Effects**: Buttons change color on hover for better interactivity
- **Text Wrapping**: Long gem names wrap properly within card boundaries
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to different window sizes
- **Character Summary**: Character info now shows gem selection progress
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for data operations

## üìÅ Data Structure

### Character Data Format
```json
{
  "name": "Character Name",
  "class": "Character Class",
  "gem_selections": {
    "Quest Name_Act Number": "Selected Gem Name",
    "Enemy at the Gate_1": "Molten Strike",
    "The Caged Brute_1": null
  }
}
```

### Selection States
- `null`: No gem selected for this quest
- `"Gem Name"`: Specific gem selected for this quest

## üéØ User Workflow

1. **Character Selection**: User selects or creates a character
2. **Quest Display**: All available quests for that character class are shown as cards
3. **Gem Selection**: User clicks on desired gems to select them
4. **Visual Feedback**: Selected gems are highlighted, others are grayed out
5. **Auto-Save**: Selections are automatically saved to config
6. **Persistence**: Selections are restored when returning to the character

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Key Methods Added/Modified
- `refresh_gem_info()`: Completely rewritten for card-based layout
- `on_gem_click()`: Handles gem selection logic
- `save_character_gem_selections()`: Manages data persistence
- `get_character_gem_summary()`: Provides selection statistics
- `update_character_info()`: Enhanced to show gem selection progress

### Layout Calculations
- **Cards per Row**: `max(1, available_width // (card_width + 20))`
- **Card Width**: `max(200, overlay_width - 20)`
- **Grid Management**: Uses tkinter's grid system with uniform column weights

### Performance Optimizations
- **Immediate UI Updates**: Changes reflect instantly in the interface
- **Efficient Data Storage**: Minimal storage footprint using quest keys
- **Memory Management**: Proper widget cleanup when refreshing display

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Improved Usability**: Much easier to see and select gems
2. **Better Organization**: Clear visual separation between quests
3. **Enhanced Functionality**: Interactive elements vs static display
4. **Data Persistence**: Never lose gem selections
5. **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes
6. **Professional Appearance**: Modern card-based UI design

## üîÑ Future Enhancements
